# Data_Dashboard

## Introduction:

This project is intended to create a data dashboard for different puropses. 

The projects is divied to following steps:
1. wrie a python code to wrangle a dataset and make it ready to work on it.
2. read the data in the format you want and use plotly package for data visualizations.
3. tweak the html so the webapp is ready and is acceceble via internet. 


## Steps:

- find the dataset of your choice
- explore and clean data set
- put the data in to csv file
- upload the data sets to the correct folder
- write a python code to read the data and apply plotly visualization
- set up virtual environment and install necessary libraries to run the app.
- run the web app in your computer to be sure that everything works
- deply the webapp to **Horuko** back-end service

## Libararies:

There are different libraries used to load the data, clean it and make visualizations in order to be used on web app.
web app is designed using the **Flask** library and the visualisations are made using the **Plotly** library. 
For cleaning dataset also we use different python libraries. 

## Motivation:

This project is designed to imporove the skills needed for data visualizations using plotly and also learn how to deploy a data dashboard. There are seveal techniques is needed to do this project such as HTML,Javascript and CSS. Flask and Plotly are the main packages which are used for easily conduction the project. The Horuko webservice is also used for deploying on the web.
